/**
 SDWebService is designed to be used to manage a set of web services that exists at a particular endpoint.
 It is meant to be subclassed to create methods that work with a particular service.
 This class supports only HTTP GET and POST methods.
 The web service endpoint and the type of requests and query formats are defined in a plist file which should be specified as documented below.
 A sample plist is available as a private gist at: https://gist.github.com/619b18f55c3ff61a908e

 ### SDWebService Property List Format Specification ###
 * `baseURL` (string): This required key describes the base URL endpoint which forms the prefix to all requests.
 * `requests` (dictionary): A dictionary comprising of a key for each type of method in the web service.
   The name of the key is used in the SDWebservice subclass to access its format from the plist.
   Each key itself points to a method dictionary.
   Each method dictionary comprises of the following keys:
     - `method` (string): The HTTP method of the request. SDWebService supports GET and POST.
     - `routeFormat` (string): The method specific string that follows the baseURL. It may contain replacement markers of the form `{replaceMe}`.
         Each of those can be replaced by the replacements defined in the routeReplacement sibling dictionary defined below.
         They can also be replaced by a routeReplacement dictionary passed into the request creation code via the performRequestWithMethod: calls.
         All replacement markers must be substituted with appropriate values using one or both or the above mechanisms when a request is being created.
     - `routeReplacement` (dictionary): This dictionaly comprises of keys that match the replacement markers in the `routeFormat` string.
         The value for each key is put in place of the replacement marker when the request is being created.
     - `postFormat` (string): The method specific string that is sent in the post body in case of a POST request. It may contain replacement markers of the form `{replaceMe}`.
         Each of those can be replaced by the replacements defined in the routeReplacement sibling dictionary defined below.
         They can also be replaced by a routeReplacement dictionary passed into the request creation code via the performRequestWithMethod: calls.
         All replacement markers must be substituted with appropriate values using one or both or the above mechanisms when a request is being created.

 ### Blocks in use are defined as:
    // Handles data processing for a given connection.  `response` will be an NSHTTPURLResponse 99% of the time.  
    // The return/result is the dataObject that will eventually be passed to SDWebServiceUICompletionBlock.
    // This block is run on a separate GCD thread.
    typedef id (^SDWebServiceDataCompletionBlock)(NSURLResponse *response, NSInteger statusCode, NSData *responseData, NSError *error);
 
    // The dataObject parameter is the result of SDWebServiceDataCompletionBlock.  UI updates of the contained data should
    // happen here.  This block is always run on the main thread.
    typedef void (^SDWebServiceUICompletionBlock)(id dataObject, NSError *error);
